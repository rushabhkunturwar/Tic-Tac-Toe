## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

- Two-player mode (X and O)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Winning message display
- Draw detection
- Reset/restart functionality

## How to Play

Click on the boxes in the game grid to make your move. The game alternates between X and O. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all boxes are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
